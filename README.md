### Steps I took and Assignment Requirments
I first opened github and created my repository: Mjwsr145/CIS445_545_HW2. I then opened vs code and performed the git clone command to create the folders on my local machine. 

Once inside the local folder I created the html file: michalewalker_profile.html and this README.md file

Once I had the html file created I used some of the information from project #1 to create the content for my profile page. In project #1 I used separate files for my css and javescript so with this homework I decided to use these tools within the main html document.

I started with the main content and the css style of the page.

Once I had that how I wanted I created the link to my image for the page.

Next step was to do something with the left side of the page. I added the email me link and some header information about me. Nothing fancy but wanted to add some content for that left area of the page.

The final step was to add some javascript. This was somewhat of a challenge to make it work as I wanted. I tried a few things but settled on putting the date at the top of the left part of the page. Creating an onload event in the body tag was the best way I could come up with to make this happen.
